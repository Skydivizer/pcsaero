-- Pro tip --
Generate and simulate a model with gen.py time --YOUR_FLAGS
Then use ./SCRIPT_NAME -l GENERATED_MODEL
This allows multiple scripts to be called on a single model state without
needing to simulate everything all over again.

You can even continue the model with
./gen.py -l GENERATED_MODEL time
